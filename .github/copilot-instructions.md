# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines
- User prefers test cases to include comments explaining the rationale of the assertions, not just descriptive test names.
- Whenever code changes are made, all affected tests must be identified and run, and the task is not finished until all those tests pass.
- For branch names, use PascalCase and avoid dashes; underscores are allowed sparingly. Use branch Features/AnyAtt_Support for this work.
- Ensure round-tripping between SDC OM and XML is covered in tests to handle complex and unexpected ad-hoc attribute cases, including support for multiple mixed namespaces and inherited/default namespace usage.
- Include tests for legal and illegal ad-hoc attribute content, with proper escaping and graceful handling of illegal content.
- When test stub files are created with a leading underscore, remove the underscore from the file name once the stubs are completed, including retroactively for files already completed.
- Unit tests running > 1 second and functional/integration tests running > 10 seconds are considered failed and must be aborted; root cause must be identified and a fix plan presented; tests must never be allowed to enter an infinite loop.
